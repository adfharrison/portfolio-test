      Fantast Premier League is a fantasy team-building game based on the world's most well
      known football (soccer) league. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The game can be played online or through a dedicated app. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You are given a budget of 100 million(fake money, obviously), to buy a squad of 
      15 players consisting of 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders and 3 forwards 
      with the added rule of being able to select a maximum of 3 players from any particular 
      Barclays Premier League team. The cost of a player is pre-determined by the game developers,
      based on the player's popularity and performance in the last football season.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objective of the game is to create the best team possible and earn maximum points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players register on the app or online, and are instantly entered into leagues with other 
      players based on geographical location, teams supported, and one giant global league containing
      all 7 million players (at last count). There are various prizes available. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The most fun aspect however is the ability to create leagues with your colleagues and friends
      and battle it out through the season.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game has become so popular that it has begun to permeate the real world football ecosphere,
      being mentioned by players, pundits and managers alike. There has even been interest shown
      by such luminaries as chess Grandmasters, Theoretical physicists and statisticians, proving that the allure
      of gambling on human skill coupled with conrete and extremely extensive statistical data can be
      fun for people from all walks of life (as well as providing the perfect exuse to watch as many games as possible).
