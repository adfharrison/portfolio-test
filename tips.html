    <p>
      1. Don’t pick a ‘balanced’ side.
      You’re not a real manager, you’re not sending a squad out to win on the weekend. You’re looking to accumulate as many points 
      as possible, also it’s imperative that you select the most effective players to that end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avoid defensive midfielders such as N’Golo Kante or hard-working forwards like Roberto Firmino who, while excellent in their own right,
      don’t bring in a lot of returns. Focus on the players who are most likely to get points via goals, assists, clean sheets and, 
      in the case of goalkeepers, saves.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Pick players who are certain to start.
      This may sound obvious, but you want a starting XI that is going to be as nailed on as possible to start each and every game. 
      Too many FPL managers pick players in the hope that they will get minutes rather than know they are a certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what makes Manchester City assets so frustrating; the Pep Rotation Roulette ensures that we will all be burned at some 
      point or another for owning one or more of their brilliant footballers. But in general it is wise to make sure a player is more than 
      likely going to start before adding them to your team.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Plan ahead by looking at future fixtures.
      Although the Premier League can be an unpredictable league, planning ahead is essential in FPL. Look at which teams have the best 
      fixtures over the next month or so to get an idea of which players you want to focus on. This will help you make smarter transfer 
      decisions over the long-term, rather than reacting to the most recent happenings in the league.

      Fantasy Football Hub’s <a class="hyperlink" href="https://fantasyfootballhub.co.uk/fixture-ticker/" target="_blank">Fixture Ticker</a> can help you determine which club has the best or worst fixtures over a selected period of 
      time based on how difficult or easy their upcoming opponents are. This is a vital tool, as no one wants to buy a player who is 
      facing down the barrel of a tough run of fixtures.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Don’t be too clever when picking a captain.
      There is sometimes the temptation to take a chance when it comes to captaincy and make a leftfield pick. After all, high risk, 
      high reward, right?

      The truth is this is a dangerous strategy that will leave you with egg on your face more often than not. Sure, Michail Antonio scored 
      four against Norwich City last year, and a few lucky managers captained him that fateful weekend, but instances such as those are few and far between.

      You are far better off captaining those premium assets who are taking up such a huge part of your budget. There’s a reason why Salah,
      Kevin De Bruyne and Sadio Mané are so expensive – so you might as well give them the armband, especially when they’re on form. 
      Otherwise, what are they doing in your team?
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Be on the lookout for players playing "out of position". In Sheffield United's promotion year, their defender John Lundstram was primarily
      utilised in an advanced midfield role. This season, in the Premier League, the FPL game continued to categorize him as a defender, and, because 
      defenders get 2 more points for a goal than a striker, Lundstram's advanced real life position, coupled with his low cost, made him a prize asset.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Use stats to plug gaps.
      Watching football with your own eyes is better than viewing it through a spreadsheet, but as an FPL manager, it is essential that you use statistics to 
      supplement your knowledge of the game. After all, you can only watch so much football and your eyes can deceive you.

      If a player passes the ‘eye test’, then it does no harm to check the underlying numbers to confirm if you’re really on to something. It used to be
      quite difficult to find publicly available football data, but now there are a whole host of excellent websites offering the best of data for free.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. And finally - Have Fun! don't let the game consume your life, switch off from time to time, and especially don't let it ruin
      your enjoyment of The Beautiful Game itself.
