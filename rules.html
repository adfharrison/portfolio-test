      Introduction to Fantasy Premier League

     The basic premise of the game is relatively simple, making it very accessible to beginners.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are given a budget of a theoretical Â£100million. this must be spent on building a squad of
      15 players (11 starting and 4 on the substitutes bench). Prices are set by the game prior to the 
      real football season starting. They tend to be based on the player's performance in the previous
      season. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You may have no more than 3 players from each Premier League team, and your 15 man squad must comprise
      of 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders and 3 forwards. The allocation of players to these positions
      are set by the game, and do not change throughout the season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players earn your team points in various ways, including goals scored, assists provided and clean
      sheets kept, amongst some other more complex but minor ways. They may also lose points through
      conceding too many goals, or recieving yellow or red cards, or conceding penalties or own goals.
      Your points are tallied at the end of each gameweek and that becomes your weekly total.
      Your final game position is given when the very last game off the season is concluded. Very importantly,
      your "captain" that you pic keach week, earns double points.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one of your players doesnt play that week, then the first player on your bench is substituted in,
      and you recieve thir points instead, if more do not play, your second bench player is used, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may change your team each week, using the Transfers feature. You must always stay within your budget
      and player/team limit. You get 1 transfer per week, but if you wish to make more you can, however each extra 
      transfer incurs a 4 point penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are 3 special "chips" you may play once each throughout the season. these are "free hit", which
      lets you change your entire team (within the rules) for one week, after which it reverts to how it was before
      you played the chip. Secondly, there is "bench boost", which for one week contributes all 15 of your player's scores
      towards your total. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, there is the much discussed "Wildcard", which you actually get twice a year, once before and once after the new year.
      This allows you to permanently change your entire team for no points-penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is it for the rules basics, youll grasp the rest as you go, or you can follow the FPL link in the sidebar
      and read more for yourself.
